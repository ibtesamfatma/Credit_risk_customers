Credit Risk Customers Dataset 💳

Dataset Overview 🔍
This dataset offers a comprehensive view of customers and their creditworthiness. It's a goldmine for building credit risk prediction models.

Format: Comma-separated values (CSV)


Data Exploration (EDA) 📊
We dived deep into the data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between features and credit risk. Here's what we found:

Numerical Features: Kernel density estimation (KDE) plots revealed intriguing insights:
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Lower debt-to-income ratios were strongly linked to good creditworthiness. 📈📉


Credit Utilization: Similar to debt-to-income ratio, lower credit utilization indicated better credit standing. 💳

Categorical Features: We'll explore these further to uncover their impact on credit risk. 🕵️‍♀️
Data Preprocessing & Modeling 🤖
To prepare the data for our model, we transformed categorical features like 'checking_status', 'savings_status', and 'employment' into numerical values using OrdinalEncoder. 🔄

Then, we built a Decision Tree Classifier with a max depth of 5. It achieved an accuracy of 0.685 in predicting credit risk. 🌳
